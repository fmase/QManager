/**
 * Polls auth/check.sh every POLL_INTERVAL_MS while the dashboard is mounted.
 *
 * check.sh skips auth and always answers HTTP 200 with {authenticated:bool},
 * so this poller must inspect BOTH the transport and the body:
 *
 * - Transport failure (network error OR non-2xx) → counts toward the offline
 *     threshold:
 *     - at WARN_AT fails  → shows the "reconnecting" banner
 *     - at FAILURE_THRESHOLD fails → redirect:
 *         * if a reboot we initiated is in flight → /reboot/ countdown
 *         * otherwise (unexplained silence)       → /login/?reason=offline
 * - Reachable but {authenticated:false} → session is gone (e.g. a reboot wiped
 *     /tmp sessions, or it simply expired) → redirect to /login/ immediately.
 *     This is the normal recovery path once the device returns.
 * - Reachable and authenticated         → resets the counter and hides banner.
 *
 * Note: a bare `await authFetch()` is NOT enough — fetch only rejects on a true
 * network error, so a 5xx (or a dev-proxy 502 while the modem is down) would
 * otherwise be miscounted as a success and defeat the whole poller.
