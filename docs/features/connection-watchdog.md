# Connection Watchdog (`qmanager_watchcat`)

`qmanager_watchcat` is QManager's connection health daemon. It monitors internet reachability via the ping daemon's output and, when connectivity fails or degrades, executes a tiered recovery ladder: network re-registration → radio toggle → SIM failover → system reboot. The daemon is opt-in and disabled by default on fresh installs.

## Dual-Trigger Model

The watchdog has two independent paths into the recovery ladder.

**Reachability trigger (always active when watchdog is enabled):** The daemon reads `qmanager_ping.json` every cycle. If `streak_fail` rises above `max_failures` consecutive cycles, the reachability path fires, sets `recovery_reason="unreachable"`, and runs `do_recovery`.

**Quality trigger (opt-in, `quality_enabled=0` by default):** On every cycle while in `monitor` or `suspect` state, the daemon also calls `evaluate_quality`. If either `avg_latency_ms` or `packet_loss_pct` exceeds its ceiling for `quality_consecutive` consecutive cycles, the quality path fires, sets `recovery_reason="quality"`, and runs the same `do_recovery` engine.

The two paths are independent. Each has its own counter. A quality breach does not advance the reachability `failure_counter`, and vice versa.

## State Machine

```
MONITOR ──── streak_fail > 0 ─────────────────→ SUSPECT
   ↑                                                │
   │           quality breach × consecutive         │ failure_counter >= max_failures
   │         ↗ (evaluate_quality)                   ↓
   │ (restored)                              RECOVERY → do_recovery() → COOLDOWN
   │                                                                        │
   └──────────────── connectivity/quality restored ────────────────────────┘
   └──────────────── escalate: find_next_tier ─────→ SUSPECT (re-enter)
   
LOCKED  ← any maintenance condition (lock file / long-running AT / profile apply)
DISABLED ← Tier 4 auto-disabled after max_reboots_per_hour exhausted
```

`evaluate_quality` runs only in `monitor` and `suspect` states, never during `cooldown` or `locked`.

## Recovery Tier Ladder

| Tier | Action | AT commands | Skip condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Network re-registration | `AT+COPS=2` → 2 s → `AT+COPS=0` | None — always runs if enabled |
| 2 | Radio toggle | `AT+CFUN=0` → 3 s → `AT+CFUN=1` | Tower lock active; long-running AT flag |
| 3 | SIM failover | `AT+CFUN=0` → `AT+QUIMSLOT=N` → `AT+CFUN=1` (Golden Rule) | No backup slot; already on backup slot |
| 4 | System reboot | `sleep 1 && reboot` | Token bucket: `max_reboots_per_hour`; auto-disables on breach |

**Why Tier 1 uses AT+COPS, not ifdown/ifup:** `ifdown wan; ifup wan` bounces only the host-side network interface. It has no effect on a stalled modem attach — the modem's radio connection to the cell tower is independent of the host interface state. `AT+COPS=2` (forced manual mode, deregisters) followed by `AT+COPS=0` (auto mode, re-registers) tells the modem to drop and re-initiate the network registration procedure, which is the correct action for a stalled attach.

**Why Tier 2 is skipped under tower lock:** `AT+CFUN=0/1` power-cycles the radio subsystem and clears all tower lock state. Doing that while the user has a tower lock configured would silently undo their lock.

**Why Tier 3 is off by default (`tier3_enabled=0`):** SIM failover requires a backup SIM to be configured and present. Enabling it without a backup slot results in the tier being skipped silently every cycle. The frontend requires a backup slot to be selected before Tier 3 can be saved as enabled.

## UCI Configuration Schema

### Full watchcat section

Seeded by `ensure_watchcat_config()` in `watchdog.sh` on first CGI GET, and by `install.sh`'s `seed_uci_defaults()` for the quality keys specifically.

| UCI Key | Range | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | 0/1 | 0 | Master on/off for the daemon |
| `max_failures` | int 1–20 | 5 | Consecutive failed ping cycles before recovery |
| `check_interval` | int 5–60 | 10 | Seconds between cycles |
| `cooldown` | int 10–300 | 60 | Seconds to wait after a recovery action before evaluating success |
| `tier1_enabled` | 0/1 | 1 | Enable Tier 1 (re-registration) |
| `tier2_enabled` | 0/1 | 1 | Enable Tier 2 (radio toggle) |
| `tier3_enabled` | 0/1 | 0 | Enable Tier 3 (SIM failover) |
| `tier4_enabled` | 0/1 | 1 | Enable Tier 4 (reboot) |
| `backup_sim_slot` | 1/2 | (empty) | SIM slot for Tier 3 failover |
| `max_reboots_per_hour` | int 1–10 | 3 | Tier 4 token bucket; auto-disables at limit |

### Quality trigger keys (new in this feature)

| UCI Key | Range | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `quality_enabled` | 0/1 | 0 | Master opt-in for quality triggering |
| `latency_ceiling_ms` | int 0–10000 | 800 | `avg_latency_ms` ceiling; **0 = ignore latency** |
| `loss_ceiling_pct` | int 0–100 | 20 | `packet_loss_pct` ceiling; **0 = ignore loss** |
| `quality_consecutive` | int 1–60 | 5 | Consecutive breach cycles before recovery fires |

> ℹ️ NOTE: The installer seeds only the four quality keys via `seed_uci_defaults()`, not the full watchcat section. The rest of the section is seeded lazily on the first CGI GET by `ensure_watchcat_config()`. This preserves existing user configuration on upgrade.

---

## Quality Trigger Invariants

### 1. Ceiling 0 means ignore that metric

Setting `latency_ceiling_ms=0` skips the latency check entirely. Setting `loss_ceiling_pct=0` skips the loss check. If both are 0 while `quality_enabled=1`, the trigger can never fire. The frontend blocks saving this combination when quality is enabled — at least one ceiling must be greater than 0.

### 2. Data source and staleness guard

Latency and loss come from `status.json` `.connectivity.avg_latency_ms` and `.connectivity.packet_loss_pct`, which are written by the poller. The `.connectivity` object has no timestamp of its own, so freshness is judged from the root `.timestamp` field against `STATUS_STALE_THRESHOLD=30` seconds.

A stale or missing `status.json` is treated as NO-SIGNAL: the `evaluate_quality` function returns early, and the breach counter is left unchanged. A stale poller is never treated as a healthy 0% loss reading.

**Why:** The poller could have crashed or been restarted. Treating the absence of data as 0% loss would mean a dead poller looks like a perfect connection, causing the quality trigger to never fire even when the link is genuinely bad. The NO-SIGNAL policy is the conservative choice.

### 3. Float comparison must use awk

`avg_latency_ms` in `status.json` is a decimal string (e.g. `"1241.4"`). BusyBox `[ "1241.4" -gt 800 ]` returns exit code 2 — it does not evaluate the comparison, it errors. Latency comparison therefore uses awk:

```sh
awk -v a="$q_avg_latency" -v c="$CFG_LATENCY_CEILING_MS" \
    'BEGIN{ exit !((a+0) > (c+0)) }'
```

`packet_loss_pct` is an integer in the source; it is safe to use `[ -ge ]` after null/empty → 0 sanitisation.

> ⚠️ WARNING: This is a reusable BusyBox gotcha. Any shell script that compares a value sourced from the poller's `avg_latency_ms` with `[ -gt ]` will silently misbehave. Always use awk for float comparisons.

### 4. Separate counter, shared ladder

The quality path maintains `quality_breach_counter` independently of the reachability path's `failure_counter`. On reaching `quality_consecutive` breaches, `evaluate_quality` resets `quality_breach_counter` to 0, sets `recovery_reason="quality"`, and calls `do_recovery` — the same Tier 1→4 engine used by the reachability path. The reachability path sets `recovery_reason="unreachable"`.

### 5. Reason-aware cooldown

`finish_cooldown()` branches on `recovery_reason` to choose its success criterion.

- **`recovery_reason="unreachable"`:** Success = `ping_reachable=true` from a fresh `qmanager_ping.json` read. If this was Tier 3, finalize SIM failover state.
- **`recovery_reason="quality"`:** A degraded-but-reachable link reports `reachable=true` throughout, so the reachability check would always declare success. Instead, success is a fresh `read_quality` call that does NOT breach the configured ceilings (`!quality_breached`). Tier-3 SIM failover finalization is NOT run from the quality path — that finalization is only meaningful for connectivity failures, not latency/loss scenarios.

**Why:** Without this branch, a quality-triggered recovery on a link that is reachable but slow would always be declared "restored" at cooldown, even if the link is still slow. The daemon would cycle through all tiers in quick succession.

### 6. States where evaluate_quality runs

`evaluate_quality` is called at the bottom of the main loop only when `state = "monitor"` or `state = "suspect"`. It does not run during `cooldown`, `locked`, or `recovery`. The quality breach counter is reset on:
- Natural `suspect → monitor` recovery.
- LOCKED state entry and exit.
- Quality trigger firing (counter resets to 0 before `do_recovery`).
- Quality cooldown success.

### 7. Effective detection latency

`avg_latency_ms` and `packet_loss_pct` in `status.json` are already computed as windowed averages over approximately 60 samples by the poller. Setting `quality_consecutive=5` with `check_interval=10` means the watchdog requires 50 seconds of consecutive breaches of an already-smoothed metric. Real detection time is roughly `quality_consecutive × check_interval` on top of the poller's averaging window. Do not expect instant reaction to a brief spike.

### 8. Reboot-loop safety

A persistently degraded link that escalates to Tier 4 is bounded by the existing `max_reboots_per_hour` token bucket. On reaching the limit, the daemon auto-disables by writing `quecmanager.watchcat.enabled=0` to UCI and exiting. `quality_enabled` being default-off is the first safety layer; the token bucket is the second.

## Daemon State File (`/tmp/qmanager_watchcat.json`)

Written atomically via `STATE_TMP` → `mv`. The CGI GET passes the full file contents through as the `status` field in the response, so the frontend settings page receives it automatically.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `timestamp` | int (epoch) | When state was last written |
| `enabled` | bool | Whether daemon is enabled |
| `state` | string | Current state: `monitor`/`suspect`/`recovery`/`cooldown`/`locked`/`disabled` |
| `current_tier` | int | Active recovery tier (0 = none) |
| `failure_count` | int | Reachability failure counter |
| `last_recovery_time` | int or null | Epoch of last recovery action |
| `last_recovery_tier` | int or null | Tier of last recovery action |
| `total_recoveries` | int | Total recovery actions since daemon start |
| `cooldown_remaining` | int | Seconds remaining in cooldown |
| `sim_failover_active` | bool | Whether modem is currently on the backup SIM |
| `original_sim_slot` | int or null | SIM slot before Tier 3 |
| `current_sim_slot` | int or null | Current SIM slot |
| `reboots_this_hour` | int | Reboots from crash.log in last 3600s |
| `quality_breach_count` | int | Current consecutive quality breach counter |
| `quality_enabled` | bool | Reflects `CFG_QUALITY_ENABLED` at time of write |
| `last_recovery_reason` | string | `"unreachable"` or `"quality"` |

> ℹ️ NOTE: The poller re-emits a `watchcat` object into `status.json`, but it does NOT yet carry `quality_breach_count`, `quality_enabled`, or `last_recovery_reason`. A live breach-counter readout in the watchdog status card is a deliberate follow-up feature, out of scope for this change.

## CGI Envelope

### GET `/cgi-bin/quecmanager/monitoring/watchdog.sh`

Returns current UCI settings, live daemon state, SIM failover state, SIM swap detection, and auto-disabled flag.

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "settings": {
    "enabled": false,
    "max_failures": 5,
    "check_interval": 10,
    "cooldown": 60,
    "tier1_enabled": true,
    "tier2_enabled": true,
    "tier3_enabled": false,
    "tier4_enabled": true,
    "backup_sim_slot": null,
    "max_reboots_per_hour": 3,
    "quality_enabled": false,
    "latency_ceiling_ms": 800,
    "loss_ceiling_pct": 20,
    "quality_consecutive": 5
  },
  "status": { ... },
  "sim_failover": { "active": false },
  "sim_swap": { "detected": false },
  "auto_disabled": false
}
```

`status` is the raw contents of `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat.json`; it is `{}` if the file is absent (daemon not yet started). `settings.backup_sim_slot` is `null` if the UCI value is empty.

### POST `/cgi-bin/quecmanager/monitoring/watchdog.sh`

Three actions are supported.

**`save_settings`** — validate and write all settings fields to UCI, touch the reload flag, and restart or stop the daemon as appropriate.

```json
{
  "action": "save_settings",
  "enabled": true,
  "max_failures": 5,
  "check_interval": 10,
  "cooldown": 60,
  "tier1_enabled": true,
  "tier2_enabled": true,
  "tier3_enabled": false,
  "tier4_enabled": true,
  "backup_sim_slot": null,
  "max_reboots_per_hour": 3,
  "quality_enabled": true,
  "latency_ceiling_ms": 800,
  "loss_ceiling_pct": 20,
  "quality_consecutive": 5
}
```

**`dismiss_sim_swap`** — sets `.dismissed = true` in `/tmp/qmanager_sim_swap_detected`.

**`revert_sim`** — writes `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat_revert_sim`; the running daemon picks it up within one cycle.

**POST success:**

```json
{ "success": true }
```

**POST validation errors:**

```json
{ "success": false, "error": "invalid_field", "field": "latency_ceiling_ms", "reason": "must be integer 0-10000" }
```

| Field | Validation |
|---|---|
| `max_failures` | int 1–20 |
| `check_interval` | int 5–60 |
| `cooldown` | int 10–300 |
| `max_reboots_per_hour` | int 1–10 |
| `backup_sim_slot` | 1 or 2, or null/absent to clear |
| `latency_ceiling_ms` | int 0–10000 |
| `loss_ceiling_pct` | int 0–100 |
| `quality_consecutive` | int 1–60 |

> ℹ️ NOTE: The CGI error envelope uses `reason` rather than `detail` for field validation errors (field-level errors need to name the field). The hook `useWatchdogSettings` passes `json.reason` as the `detail` argument to `resolveErrorMessage`.

## Apply / Reload Pipeline

```
POST save_settings
  ↓
Validate fields
uci commit quecmanager
touch /tmp/qmanager_watchcat_reload
  ↓
if enabled:
    /etc/init.d/qmanager_watchcat enable
    /etc/init.d/qmanager_watchcat restart (fire-and-forget)
    rm -f /tmp/qmanager_watchcat_disabled
else:

    /etc/init.d/qmanager_watchcat disable
  ↓
Running daemon: checks RELOAD_FLAG at top of each loop iteration,
calls read_config(), removes flag.
```

Config changes take effect within one `check_interval` cycle (5–60 s). No full daemon restart is needed for quality ceiling or consecutive changes when the daemon is already running.

## Frontend Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `hooks/use-watchdog-settings.ts` | Fetch (30s poll) + save + SIM-dismiss/revert; types `WatchdogSettings`, `WatchdogLiveStatus` |
| `components/monitoring/watchdog/watchdog-settings-card.tsx` | Settings form: tiers, quality sub-section, validation |
| `components/monitoring/watchdog/watchdog-status-card.tsx` | Live status readout (state, tier, counters) |
| `components/monitoring/watchdog/sim-swap-banner.tsx` | SIM swap / SIM failover alert banner |
| `components/monitoring/watchdog/watchdog.tsx` | Page shell |

**`WatchdogLiveStatus`** fields `quality_breach_count`, `quality_enabled`, and `last_recovery_reason` are typed as optional (`?`) because older daemon versions will not emit them. Consumers must handle their absence.

## Known Gotchas

- **Float comparison is a hard requirement.** `avg_latency_ms` is decimal. BusyBox `[ "1241.4" -gt 800 ]` exits 2 (error), not false. Any future code path that reads this field and compares it with `[ -gt ]` or `[ -ge ]` will silently fail to compare. Use awk as shown in the `quality_breached` function.

- **Ceiling 0 is a disable, not a zero threshold.** `latency_ceiling_ms=0` does not mean "trigger if any latency is above 0 ms." It means ignore the latency metric entirely. This is intentional to allow users to watch only loss, or only latency, but it is counterintuitive.

- **Detection is not instantaneous.** The status.json latency/loss values are windowed averages over ~60 poller samples. A brief spike will be absorbed by the window. Only a sustained degradation lasting across `quality_consecutive × check_interval` seconds (on top of the poller's window) will trigger recovery.

- **Quality breach counter in the status card is a follow-up.** The status card currently reads from the poller's `watchcat` re-emit in `status.json`, which does not yet carry `quality_breach_count`. The actual counter is in `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat.json` and available via the CGI GET, but no status-card widget displays it yet. This is a known gap.

- **Stale poller = NO-SIGNAL, not healthy.** If `qmanager_poller` is dead or crashed, `status.json` goes stale. The quality trigger treats this as no-signal and freezes the breach counter. This is correct behavior, but it means a dead poller silently disables quality triggering. Check `/tmp/qmanager_status.json` root `.timestamp` if the quality trigger appears to not be evaluating.

- **Auto-disable persists across reboots (UCI).** When Tier 4 exhausts `max_reboots_per_hour`, it writes `quecmanager.watchcat.enabled=0` to UCI. This survives a reboot — the daemon won't restart even though procd is configured to do so (the init.d script checks `enabled` in UCI). Re-enabling via the settings page clears the disabled flag and restarts the daemon.
