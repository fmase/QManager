# Canonical writer for the OFFICIAL-variant Tailscale procd init script.
# Sourced by BOTH the CGI (tailscale.sh -> write_ts_initd, fresh install) and
# install.sh's upgrade migration (migrate_tailscale_initd_boot_fix) so the
# on-disk /etc/init.d/tailscale never drifts between a fresh install and an OTA
# upgrade. OFFICIAL VARIANT ONLY — the tiny/opkg variant ships its own
# opkg-owned init script and must never be touched by this writer.
#
# This is NOT shipped as a static scripts/etc/init.d/tailscale file on purpose:
# install.sh force-copies every file under scripts/etc/init.d/ on each install,
# which would clobber the opkg-owned tiny init. Keeping the body here, written
# only on the official path, confines it correctly.
