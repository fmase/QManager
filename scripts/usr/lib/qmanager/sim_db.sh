# sim_db.sh — Known-SIMs database (shared library)
# =============================================================================
# Model
# -----
# QManager tracks a PERSISTENT SET of ICCIDs the device has already "seen"
# (the known-SIMs database). A SIM is "new" iff its ICCID is NOT a member of
# this set. On detection of a new SIM, its ICCID is added immediately so the
# "New SIM" banner fires exactly once.
#
# This replaces the older single-value /etc/qmanager/last_iccid scheme (which
# could only remember ONE prior SIM). sim_db_seed_if_absent() migrates that
# legacy file forward on first run.
#
# Storage
# -------
#   KNOWN_SIMS_FILE  — newline-delimited ICCIDs, one per line, no trailing
#                      whitespace per line. Lives under /etc/qmanager/ which is
#                      persistent (UBIFS, survives reboot).
#
# BYTE-PARITY REQUIREMENT
# -----------------------
# Membership is a whole-line fixed-string match (grep -qxF). The stored key
# MUST be byte-identical to the value the 5 existing QCCID read sites produce
# via the canonical pipeline:
#       grep '+QCCID:' | sed 's/+QCCID: //g' | tr -d '\r '
# i.e. a raw ~20-char string with NO trailing newline. sim_db_normalize()
# reproduces that normalization (strip space/CR/LF) so callers can pass either
# a pipeline result or a hand-built value and still match.
#
# Sourcing
# --------
# Sourced into poller, watchcat, profile_mgr, and the known_sims CGI. All
# internal variables are _simdb_-prefixed to avoid clobbering caller scope,
# and use one `local` per line (BusyBox-safe).
