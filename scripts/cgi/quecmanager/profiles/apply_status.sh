# apply_status.sh — CGI Endpoint: Profile Apply Status
# =============================================================================
# Returns the current state of a profile application in progress.
# Reads directly from /tmp/qmanager_profile_state.json (written by the
# apply script). Zero modem interaction.
#
# Also detects if the apply process has died unexpectedly (PID gone but
# status still "applying") and corrects the state.
#
# Endpoint: GET /cgi-bin/quecmanager/profiles/apply_status.sh
# Response: Contents of /tmp/qmanager_profile_state.json
#       or: {"status":"idle"} if no apply has been run
#
# Install location: /www/cgi-bin/quecmanager/profiles/apply_status.sh
